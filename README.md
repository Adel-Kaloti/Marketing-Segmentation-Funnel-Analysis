###   <h1 align="center">🎯 Main Business Questions & KPIs</h1> 
This project focuses on answering the most important marketing performance questions:

1. **Which campaigns deliver the highest performance?**  
   KPIs (Clicks, Conversion Rate, ROI, Engagement)

2. **Which marketing channels are the most effective?**  
   (YouTube, Google Ads, Instagram, etc.)

3. **How does performance differ by target audience?**  
   (Demographics, segments, behavior)

4. **How does campaign performance vary across locations?**  
   (Cities, customer markets)

5. **What is the impact of campaign duration on performance?**

6. **What is the overall global performance of all marketing campaigns?**  
   (Total clicks, impressions, spend, CTR, conversion)

### Data Modeling Highlight
To improve data quality, performance, and analytical flexibility, the original Raw_Data table was normalized and split into three separate tables:
- **dim_campaign** – campaign attributes  
- **dim_date** – full date intelligence  
- **fact_campaign_performance** – all measurable KPIs  

This structure makes analysis faster, cleaner, and BI-ready.
