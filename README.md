###   <h1 align="center">🎯 Main Business Questions & KPIs</h1> 
This project focuses on answering 4 important campaigns performance questions:

### 1️⃣ Which target audiences deliver the best performance across campaigns?
Identify which **Target_Audience** (like .. *Women 35–44, Men 25–34, All Ages*) achieves the best mix of:
- **High CTR**, **High Conversion Rate**, **Low CAC**, **High ROI**

Understanding this helps optimize audience targeting and improve overall campaign profitability.

---

### 2️⃣ How does performance change across channels for each target audience?
Analyze how the same **Target_Audience** performs across different channels  
(*Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Email*):
- Which channels require **more budget**?
- Which channels should have spending **reduced or stopped** based on low ROI?
- Which audience × channel combination brings the highest engagement?

---

### 3️⃣ Where do we lose potential customers in the marketing funnel?
Evaluate the drop-off across the funnel:  **Impressions → Clicks → Conversions**

Key goals:
- Identify **which stage has the highest drop rate**
- Compare funnel performance across different **audience segments**
- Detect segments with unusually strong or weak conversion paths

---

### 4️⃣ What data-driven recommendations can optimize budget allocation?
If the company operates with a fixed marketing budget, we determine how to **redistribute spend** across:
- **Target_Audience**, **Channel**

To: - Reduce **CAC**
    - Increase **ROI**
    - Focus spending on the **highest-value segments**

This ensures maximum impact with limited funds.

###   <h1 align="center">🎯 Data Structure & ERD</h1> 

To improve data quality, performance, and analytical flexibility, the original Raw_Data table was normalized and split into three separate tables:
- **dim_campaign** – campaign attributes  
- **dim_date** – full date intelligence  
- **fact_campaign_performance** – all measurable KPIs  

This structure makes analysis faster, cleaner, and BI-ready.
