# Marketing-Segmentation-Funnel-Analysis
Data-driven marketing project analyzing campaign performance, audience segments, and funnel KPIs using SQL Server &amp; Tableau.



### Data Modeling Highlight
To improve data quality, performance, and analytical flexibility, the original Raw_Data table was normalized and split into three separate tables:
- **dim_campaign** – campaign attributes  
- **dim_date** – full date intelligence  
- **fact_campaign_performance** – all measurable KPIs  

This structure makes analysis faster, cleaner, and BI-ready.
